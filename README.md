📊 Student Performance Analysis

This project analyzes student performance based on marks from multiple tests and attendance records. The dataset is processed using Python (Pandas, NumPy, etc.), followed by data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to extract meaningful insights. The goal is to understand how different factors like test scores and attendance influence overall student performance.




🔧 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas 📑

NumPy 🔢

Jupyter Notebook 📓

Matplotlib / Seaborn 📊




📂 Project Workflow

Data Collection – Import student marks and attendance datasets.

Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, correct formatting.

Data Transformation – Prepare data for meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize distributions and correlations.

Insights & Results – Identify how attendance and test scores impact overall performance





🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy jupyter


Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook student_performance_analysis.ipynb

Run all cells to view the analysis and outputs.




🎯 Objective

To understand how test scores and attendance affect overall student performance, and provide insights for educators and institutions




🌟 Future Enhancements

Add machine learning models to predict student performance.

Include more features (e.g., participation, assignments).
